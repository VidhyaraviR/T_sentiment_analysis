# Introduction
   The classification of sentiments in social media comments is a challenging task that involves the application of machine learning and  
   natural language processing techniques. With the growth of social media, understanding the feelings expressed by users has become 
   essential. In this work, we will approach this problem, collecting and analyzing data from previously classified comments. We will 
   apply pre-processing techniques and experiment with different classification algorithms. Through appropriate metrics, we will evaluate 
   the efficiency of the models. The objective is to understand the feelings present in social media and explore practical applications 
   of this knowledge for companies, institutions and individuals interested in understanding the public's perception. We hope to 
   contribute to informed and strategic decision-making.
