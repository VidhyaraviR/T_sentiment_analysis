# Introduction
  The classification of sentiments in social media comments is a challenging task that involves the application of machine learning and  
   natural language processing techniques. With the growth of social media, understanding the feelings expressed by users has become essential. In this work, we will approach this problem, collecting and analyzing data from previously classified comments. We will apply pre-processing techniques and experiment with different classification algorithms. Through appropriate metrics, we will evaluate the efficiency of the models. The objective is to understand the feelings present in social media and explore practical applications of this knowledge for companies, institutions and individuals interested in understanding the public's perception. We hope to contribute to informed and strategic decision-making.
